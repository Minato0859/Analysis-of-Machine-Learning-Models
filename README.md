Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Gamma-Ray Detection
Description
This independent research project leverages Machine Learning techniques in Python to classify cosmic gamma-rays and hadronic cosmic-ray backgrounds in telescopic data. The study utilizes various algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks for the classification task. The project involves feature engineering, regularization techniques, and emphasizes data pre-processing, model optimization, and results interpretation.
